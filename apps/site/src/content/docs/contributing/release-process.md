# Release Process

This document describes how Turbo Themes versions and releases are managed.

## Versioning

Turbo Themes follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **MAJOR** (1.0.0 → 2.0.0): Breaking changes
- **MINOR** (1.0.0 → 1.1.0): New features, backward compatible
- **PATCH** (1.0.0 → 1.0.1): Bug fixes, backward compatible

## Release Schedule

- **Patch releases**: As needed for bug fixes
- **Minor releases**: Monthly for new features
- **Major releases**: Annually or for significant changes

## Release Channels

| Channel | Purpose             | npm Tag  |
| ------- | ------------------- | -------- |
| Stable  | Production-ready    | `latest` |
| Beta    | Pre-release testing | `beta`   |
| Canary  | Bleeding edge       | `canary` |

## For Maintainers

### Creating a Release

1. **Ensure tests pass**

   ```bash
   bun run test
   bun run lint
   ```

2. **Update version**

   ```bash
   bun run version:patch  # or :minor or :major
   ```

3. **Update changelog**

   Edit `CHANGELOG.md` with the new version's changes.

4. **Create release commit**

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "chore: release v1.2.3"
   ```

5. **Tag the release**

   ```bash
   git tag v1.2.3
   git push origin main --tags
   ```

6. **Publish packages**

   The CI/CD pipeline handles publishing when tags are pushed:
   - npm package
   - RubyGems gem
   - PyPI package
   - Swift Package (GitHub release)

## Breaking Changes

When introducing breaking changes:

1. Document in CHANGELOG with migration guide
2. Add deprecation warnings in previous minor version
3. Update documentation
4. Consider providing codemods for automated migration

### Example Migration Guide

````markdown
## Migrating from v1.x to v2.0

### Token Renames

The following tokens have been renamed:

| Old Name             | New Name               |
| -------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `--turbo-bg-primary` | `--turbo-bg-base`      |
| `--turbo-fg-primary` | `--turbo-text-primary` |

### Storage Key Change

The localStorage key changed from `bulma-theme-flavor` to `turbo-theme`. Migration is
automatic, but you can manually migrate:

```js
const old = localStorage.getItem('bulma-theme-flavor');
if (old) {
  localStorage.setItem('turbo-theme', old);
  localStorage.removeItem('bulma-theme-flavor');
}
```
