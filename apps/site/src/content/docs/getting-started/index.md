# Introduction to Turbo Themes

Turbo Themes provides platform-agnostic design tokens that work with any CSS framework.
It's a comprehensive theming solution that gives you beautiful, consistent color schemes
across your entire application.

## What are Design Tokens?

Design tokens are CSS custom properties (variables) that define your theme's colors,
typography, spacing, and other design values. Turbo Themes provides a consistent set of
tokens that adapt to different color schemes.

## Why Turbo Themes?

With Turbo Themes, you get:

- **9 beautiful themes** including Catppuccin, Dracula, GitHub, and Bulma variants
- **Framework adapters** for Pure CSS, Bulma, and Tailwind CSS
- **Semantic tokens** for backgrounds, text, borders, and state colors
- **Syntax highlighting** support for code blocks
- **Multi-platform support** - available as npm package, Ruby gem, Python package, and
  Swift package
