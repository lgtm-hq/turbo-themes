# Contributing

Thanks for contributing! Please follow these guidelines to keep things smooth.

## Development setup

### Prerequisites

- **Bun** (recommended): 1.3+ - [Install Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation)
- **Node.js** (alternative): 22+ with npm
- **Ruby**: 3.3+ with Bundler (for gem build and Jekyll example)
- **uv**: Python package manager (required for linting) -
  [Install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

  ```bash
  curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
  ```

### Quick Start with Bun (Recommended)

```bash
# Install dependencies (5-10x faster than npm)
bun install
bundle install

# Build everything
bun run build           # TypeScript compilation
bun run build:themes    # Generate CSS themes

# Run the dev server
bun run serve           # Builds and serves with live reload
```

### Alternative: npm (if Bun is unavailable)

```bash
npm ci
bundle install
npm run build
npm run build:themes
npm run serve
```

### Build Commands

| Command                 | Description                                      |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `bun run build`         | Compile TypeScript to JavaScript                 |
| `bun run build:themes`  | Generate CSS theme files in `assets/css/themes/` |
| `bun run build:ci:site` | Build Astro site for CI                          |
| `bun run serve`         | Build and serve with live reload                 |

**Note:** CSS theme files in `assets/css/themes/` are build artifacts and are
git-ignored. They are automatically generated during the build process and should not be
committed to version control.

### Available Rake tasks

This is a hybrid Bun/Ruby project (npm compatible). Rake tasks are available for
gem-related operations:

```bash
rake -T                 # List all available tasks
rake build              # Build the Ruby gem (includes Bun build)
rake build:npm          # Build JS package (TypeScript -> JavaScript) via Bun
rake build:gem          # Build Ruby gem specifically
rake clean              # Remove built artifacts (*.gem, dist/, _site/)
rake verify:gem         # Verify gem can be built successfully
rake verify:all         # Run all checks (lint, test, and build)
rake console            # Open IRB with the gem loaded for debugging
```

Most developers will use `bun run build:gem` which handles the full build process, but
Rake tasks are useful for gem-specific operations and are required by the RubyGems
publishing workflow.

## Testing and linting

```bash
# Run tests with coverage
bun run test

# Lint code
bun run lint        # ESLint for TypeScript
bun run stylelint   # Stylelint for CSS
bun run mdlint      # Markdownlint for docs

# Format code
bun run format      # Check formatting
bun run format:write # Auto-fix formatting
```

All commands work with both `bun run` and `npm run`.

## Commits and PRs

- Use conventional commits (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`)
- Include a clear description and link to issues
- Ensure checks are green (lint, tests, typecheck if applicable)
- Be respectful and follow the Code of Conduct

## Reporting issues

- Use the templates under `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`
- Security issues: do not open public issues; see `SECURITY.md`

### Stylesheet linting

Run `bun install --frozen-lockfile` before `uv run lintro chk` so Stylelint can resolve
the pinned local presets. `bun run stylelint` runs the same configuration directly over
CSS and Sass sources.

The root configuration extends `stylelint-config-standard`; Sass files use
`stylelint-config-standard-scss` and `postcss-scss`. Tailwind directives are recognized
explicitly, while other unknown CSS at-rules remain errors. Generated build output, Sass
theme entries, and copied site assets are ignored; authored Sass and Tailwind examples
are linted. The legacy flavor picker in `src/scss/custom/_overrides.scss` may use one ID
per selector because these selectors target existing JavaScript/HTML hooks. Other styles
retain the zero-ID policy. The Sass preset replaces the CSS unknown-at-rule rule with
its Sass-aware counterpart.
