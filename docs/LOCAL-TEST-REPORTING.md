# Local Test Reporting Guide

This guide explains how to view test reports locally after running E2E tests and
Lighthouse CI.

## Overview

The project generates two types of test reports:

1. **Playwright E2E Test Report** - Visual regression, accessibility, and smoke tests
2. **Lighthouse Performance Report** - Performance metrics and audit results

## Viewing Playwright Reports Locally

### Generate the Report

Run the E2E tests to generate the Playwright HTML report:

```bash
bun run e2e:ci
```

This creates the `playwright-report/` directory with an interactive HTML report.

### View the Report

#### Option 1: Using Playwright CLI (recommended)

```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

Opens automatically at `http://localhost:9323`

#### Option 2: Using the serve script

```bash
./scripts/local/serve-reports.sh
```

View at `http://localhost:9323`

## Viewing Lighthouse Reports Locally

### Generate the Reports

Run the Lighthouse CI pipeline:

```bash
./scripts/ci/run-lighthouse-ci.sh
```

This creates the `lighthouse-reports/` directory with detailed audit results.

### View the Reports

#### Using the serve script

```bash
./scripts/local/serve-reports.sh
```

View at `http://localhost:3001/`

**Note:** The Lighthouse report is available locally in `lighthouse-reports/` after
running the CI script.

## Using the Multi-Server Script

### Prerequisites

Before running `serve-reports.sh`, ensure:

- Scripts in `scripts/` are executable (e.g.,
  `chmod +x ./scripts/local/serve-reports.sh`)
- Required tools are installed: `bash`

The `serve-reports.sh` script automatically detects which reports are available and
starts the appropriate servers:

```bash
./scripts/local/serve-reports.sh
```

**Output example:**

```
📊 Test Report Servers
=====================

✅ Playwright HTML Report found
   📍 View at: http://localhost:9323

✅ Lighthouse Reports found
   📍 View at: http://localhost:3001/

Starting report servers...

✅ Playwright server started (PID: 12345)
✅ Lighthouse server started (PID: 12346)

Press Ctrl+C to stop all servers
```

## CI Deployment

In the CI pipeline, these reports are:

1. Generated during test runs
2. Uploaded as artifacts to GitHub Actions
3. Deployed to GitHub Pages for permanent access

### Lighthouse Reports

- **Workflow**: `reporting-lighthouse-ci.yml`
- **Deploy**: `deploy-lighthouse-pages.yml`
- **Endpoint**:
  `https://<your-github-username>.github.io/<repository-name>/lighthouse-reports/`

### Playwright Reports

- **Generated in**: `quality-e2e.yml`
- **Stored as**: GitHub Actions artifacts
- **View**: In PR checks or actions run details

## Troubleshooting

### Reports not found locally

If you see errors like:

```
ERROR '/playwright' not found.
ERROR '/lighthouse' not found.
```

**Solution**: These directories are only created after running the respective tests.
Run:

```bash
bun run e2e:ci      # For Playwright report
./scripts/ci/run-lighthouse-ci.sh  # For Lighthouse reports
```

### Port already in use

If a port is already in use, you have several options:

#### macOS/Linux (Unix)

#### Option 1: Check processes first (safer)

```bash
# Check what's using the port
lsof -i:9323    # For Playwright (port 9323)
lsof -i:3001    # For Lighthouse (port 3001)

# Kill with gentler signal (allows graceful shutdown)
lsof -ti:9323 | xargs kill    # For Playwright (port 9323)
lsof -ti:3001 | xargs kill    # For Lighthouse (port 3001)
```

#### Option 2: Force kill (use only if Option 1 doesn't work)

```bash
# Force kill existing process
lsof -ti:9323 | xargs kill -9    # For Playwright (port 9323)
lsof -ti:3001 | xargs kill -9    # For Lighthouse (port 3001)
```

#### Option 3: Stop all Node processes (if you're sure)

```bash
pkill -f node    # Stops all Node.js processes
```

#### Windows

#### Option 1: Check processes first (safer)

```cmd
REM Check what's using the port
REM For Playwright (port 9323)
netstat -ano | findstr :9323
REM For Lighthouse (port 3001)
netstat -ano | findstr :3001

REM Kill the process (replace PID with the value from netstat output)
taskkill /PID <PID> /F
```

#### Option 2: One-liner to find and kill

```cmd
REM For Playwright (port 9323)
for /f "tokens=5" %%a in ('netstat -ano ^| findstr :9323') do taskkill /PID %%a /F

REM For Lighthouse (port 3001)
for /f "tokens=5" %%a in ('netstat -ano ^| findstr :3001') do taskkill /PID %%a /F
```

#### Option 3: Stop all Node processes (if you're sure)

```cmd
taskkill /IM node.exe /F
```

#### General Recommendations

1. **Check first**: Always check what process is using the port before killing it
2. **Use gentler signals**: Try `kill` without `-9` first (Unix) or `taskkill` without
   `/F` first (Windows) to allow graceful shutdown
3. **Restart terminal**: Sometimes the simplest solution is to close and restart your
   terminal session
4. **Stop Node processes**: If you're certain all Node processes can be stopped, use
   `pkill -f node` (Unix) or `taskkill /IM node.exe /F` (Windows)

After freeing the port, restart the server.

## Workflow Examples

### After Making Changes

1. Run E2E tests to check for visual regressions:

   ```bash
   bun run e2e:ci
   ```

2. View the report:

   ```bash
   npx playwright show-report
   ```

3. Review test results and screenshots

### Full Quality Check

1. Run complete CI pipeline:

   The `build.sh` script runs tests, builds the site, and performs quality checks. Use
   `--quick` for faster builds that skip cleanup and E2E tests, or run without flags for
   the full pipeline including E2E tests. See [scripts/README.md](../scripts/README.md)
   for details.

   ```bash
   ./scripts/local/build.sh --quick
   ```

2. Serve all available reports:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/local/serve-reports.sh
   ```

3. Open browsers to:
   - **Docs site**: http://localhost:4321 (Astro dev server:
     `cd apps/site && bun run dev`)
   - **Tests**: http://localhost:9323 (if available)
   - **Performance**: http://localhost:3001/ (if available)
