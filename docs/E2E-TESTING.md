## End-to-end testing (Playwright)

This project includes a complete Playwright setup covering:

- Smoke navigation and theme switching
- Accessibility checks with axe-core
- Visual regression snapshots

### Commands

- Run all E2E tests: `bun run e2e`
- UI mode: `bun run e2e:ui`
- Smoke only: `bun run e2e:smoke`
- Visual regression: `bun run e2e:visual`
- Accessibility: `bun run e2e:a11y`

### Visual testing

See `docs/PLAYWRIGHT-VISUAL-TESTS.md` for snapshot guidance and updating screenshots.

#### Snapshot fallback behavior

- Locally, missing snapshots are auto-created on first run (Playwright
  `updateSnapshots: 'missing'`).
- In CI, snapshots are never auto-updated; tests fail if a baseline is missing or
  mismatched.
- To intentionally refresh baselines locally, run:
  `bun run e2e:visual -- --update-snapshots`.

### Local reports

See `docs/LOCAL-TEST-REPORTING.md` for serving Playwright, Lighthouse, and coverage
reports locally.

### CI

Playwright is integrated into GitHub Actions via `quality-e2e.yml`. It generates PR
comments and uploads artifacts for reports.

Linux visual baselines for CI should be regenerated with
`maintenance-generate-snapshots.yml` (aligned with the full e2e job environment) so
font/system packages match verification.
