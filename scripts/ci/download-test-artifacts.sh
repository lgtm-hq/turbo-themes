#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Download test report artifacts from all test workflows for a given commit SHA
# Usage: download-test-artifacts.sh [COMMIT_SHA]
# - COMMIT_SHA: Git commit SHA to find workflows for (default: current HEAD)
#
# Downloads artifacts from:
# - Quality Check - CI Pipeline → coverage-html
# - Quality Check - E2E Tests → playwright-report
# - Reporting - Lighthouse CI → lighthouse-reports
# - Quality Check - Examples → examples-playwright-report
# - Quality Check - Multi-Language Coverage → coverage-python-html, coverage-ruby-html, coverage-swift-html
#
# Fallback behavior:
# When path-triggered workflows (Examples, Multi-Language Coverage) haven't run for the
# specific commit, the script falls back to fetching the most recent artifacts from main branch.
# This ensures reports remain available even when Renovate PRs are merged without touching
# the relevant paths.
#
# Environment Variables:
#   GITHUB_REPOSITORY: GitHub repository in owner/repo format
#   GITHUB_TOKEN: GitHub token for API access (if not using gh CLI auth)
